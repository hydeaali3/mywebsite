  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <div class="text1">
    Heyo! I'm Hydea an artist who capturesthe moment and my experience of life and discovery. My art is deeply personally driven by my own life and experiences. When people look at my work, I want them to look inward, to pause, and to be present.
I explore many different mediums, but my primary focus is photography, illustration, and painting. More than anything, my work is about observing, feeling, and expressing in the moment—capturing what catches my eye without hesitation.
  </div>
  <h2>Creative Journey & Influences</h2>
  <div class="text1">I’m not exactly sure what inspired me to become an artist. Looking back, it may have started as a form of escapism from my home life as a kid. But today, my creative direction is shaped by being more observant and present. I strive to notice the world around me, embrace spontaneity, and document what resonates with me in real-time.
    My biggest influence isn’t a specific artist or movement—it’s the constant pursuit of growth. The idea of always striving to be better than I was yesterday is what pushes me forward.
    I have a bachelor's degree in graphic design, which has given me a strong foundation in visual storytelling, branding, and problem-solving through design.
    </div>
    <h2>Projects & Collaborations</h2>
    <div class="text1"> Collaboration is something I love—bringing ideas together to create. Some of my recent projects include:
      <li>Training Company for Doulas – I’ve been collaborating with my friend and business partner, Taffanie Jonson, on branding and event planning for a new doula training company.</li>
      <li>Baking Business Branding – I worked with a co-worker to develop branding for her baking business.</li>
      <li>Baking Business Branding – I worked with a co-worker to develop branding for her baking business.</li>
      <li> Eco-Justice Center Website – I designed a new website for the Eco-Justice Center, working with a team of programmers to improve both design and functionality while communicating directly with the client.</li>
      <li>Kenosha & Cosenza Mural Project – I had the opportunity to work with fellow designers on a mural project connecting Kenosha, WI, and Cosenza, Italy.</li>
      Out of everything I’ve worked on, I’m most proud of my branding and website design projects. Helping businesses and organizations create something meaningful is incredibly fulfilling.
    </div>
  <h2>Art & Connection</h2>
  <div class="text1">Art is my way of figuring myself out, and in doing so, it helps me connect with and understand the world around me. My strong interest in people—why they do what they do, and how they express themselves—naturally weaves into my creative work.  </div>
  <div class="text1">Right now, my focus is on expression, understanding, and connection. Over time, I want to refine and “perfect” my craft, but more importantly, I want my art to deepen my understanding of myself and the people around me.
  </div>
  <div class="text1">I’m looking for open and fun collaborations, as well as professional projects that challenge me as a creative. Whether it's branding, storytelling, or something completely unexpected, I’m always excited to connect and create.
